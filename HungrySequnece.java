/*Iahub and Iahubina went to a date at a luxury restaurant. Everything went fine until paying for the food. Instead of money, the waiter wants Iahub to write a Hungry sequence consisting of n integers.

A sequence a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers, is Hungry if and only if:

Its elements are in increasing order. That is an inequality ai < aj holds for any two indices i, j (i < j).
For any two indices i and j (i < j), aj must not be divisible by ai.
Iahub is in trouble, so he asks you for help. Find a Hungry sequence with n elements.
